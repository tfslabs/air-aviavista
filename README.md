# Air AviaVista

Air AviaVista is a fictional aviation company hosting many demo deployments for further security projects, hosted by @TheFlightSims.

This company eco-system provides flexible deployments of the testing environment.

## Why Air AviaVista?

Air AviaVista is an international aviation company. It is based on various deployments of aviation companies in real life. The main reason we chose that name was all the recommendations from [@shiroinekotfs](https://github.com/shiroinekotfs) when she mentioned the fictional company where we contribute and start investigating the security problems on Air AviaVista demo deployments.

### The rise of Air AviaVista

The headquarters is located in Miami Intl. Airport, Miami, Florida, United States. According to the 2023 revenue report:

> In 2023, Air AviaVista served over 1 million passengers around the globe, with a fleet of 10 aircraft. The busiest route is from Miami to Boston. Over 6 destination cities' airports are owned or operated mostly by Air AviaVista.

### Fleet of Air AviaVista

Air AviaVista is the most-rich aircraft operating party, as well as the 5-star ranking airline ever! The fleet of Air AviaVista includes:

* 2 [Airbus A350-900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350)
* 4 [Airbus A320neo (with both CFM and PW1000G configurations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320neo_family)
* 4 [Boeing 737 Max 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX)

Also, in each of the destinations, the Air AviaVista always has an owned and self-operating hangar and full-rich the engineers. The fleet is managed by a team of experienced professionals with expertise in aviation, software development, and DevOps practices.

### Destinations

In 2023, the Air AviaVista has flown over 700,000 nautical miles (1,296,400 kilometers) with 0 minor or major accidents, and very few delays (only 2 delays/1000 flights, mostly caused by the weather). That amazing achievement is made by choosing a low ratio of the flight routes flying over high-terrain/extreme weather routes or no-rich ground service airports, and destinations run by the most trusted governments and friendly airport operators:

* Miami International Airport (ICAO: KMIA)
* Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport (ICAO: KFLL)
